In this repo, we include the 1st Place submission to [AICity Challenge](https://www.aicitychallenge.org/) 2020 re-id track (Baidu-UTS submission)

We fuse the models trained on Paddlepaddle and Pytorch. To illustrate them, we provide the two training parts seperatively as following. 

- We include the [Paddlepaddle](https://github.com/PaddlePaddle/Paddle) training code at [Here](https://github.com/miraclebiu/PaddleReid) (will update soon).
- We include the [Pytorch](https://pytorch.org/) training code at [Here](https://github.com/layumi/AICIty-reID-2020/tree/master/pytorch).
